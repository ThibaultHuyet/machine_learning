# Machine Learning

This repo is a place where I put a lot of the various machine learning projects I picked up to learn some of the principles of machine learning.

## Cats vs Dogs

This is a Kaggle competition repo. I'm looking through some of the tutorials and blog posts with regards to this competition to see what I can learn about CNNs using this competition.

the cats_vs_dogs notebook is based from this [Keras](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) blog post. I mostly did a lot of the stuff on automating the organization of the data. The main model section is from the blog post and then I try to predict one of the pictures. According to Keras, the model I trained has about 80% accuracy.
